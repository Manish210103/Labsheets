/*
    13. Meadowdale Dairy Farm sells organic brown eggs to local customers. It charges $3.25 for a
        dozen eggs, or 45 cents for individual eggs that are not part of a dozen. Write a program that
        prompts a user for the number of eggs in the order and then display the amount owed with a
        full explanation. For example, typical output might be, You ordered 27 eggs. Thatâ€™s 2 dozen at
        $3.25 per dozen and 3 loose eggs at 45 cents each for a total of $7.85.
